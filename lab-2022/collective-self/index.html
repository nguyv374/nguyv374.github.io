	<!-- CONCEPTUAL ORIGIN -->
		<h2>Conceptual Origin</h2>
		<p>To start off this project we had to take a look back into our hstory on the internet. In a short summary I found myself on online games most of the time whether it was free adventure type like Club Penguin or free mini dress up games like the ones on My Scene. These games definietly influenced me because of the customization factor. Then as I got older I found myself using the internet more for inspiration like from Pinterest or Instagram. My online usage also consisted of alot of online shopping now as well.</p>
		<p>My first direction I had for this project was to make my own dress up game combine with Pinterest where yo could save the outfit into different collections you want based on the type of outfit you're going for. This idea in the end was dropped due to the fact there was much of an avatar or function really. I then refined my idea  to make my dress up games into reality. I created a twitter account to make group orders for packs of clothes that I then randomly select pieces for the people that join. I have them fill out a form and then add them to a group chat to send them updates but also to get to know my buyers more to help curate stuff for them.</p>


	<!-- PROCRESS -->
		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>My Poject required me to work on multiple things at once.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Curate a collection. Collection different pieces for the random packs.</li>
			<li>In Illustrator, create "packs" and organize the pieces.</li>
			<li>Create a Twitter and a post.</li>
			<li>Create a Googlr Form.</li>
			<li>Create a group chat with joiners.</li>
		</ol>


	<!-- Reflections -->
		<h2>Reflections</h2>
		<p>I'm glad I came out with something a little concrete in the end. To be honest I had alot of trouble coming up with something to do. I wasn't sure where I was even going with this porject but I'm glad I was able to pull something together.</p>
		<p>Experiencing this procress for myself I feel more grateful for those that actually run these real group order accounts on Twitter. I simplified and shortened mine alot but for those that actually do this they must have so much work to do for this.</p>
