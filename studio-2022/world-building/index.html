		<p>Euphoria is an American teen drama television series created and written by Sam Levinson for HBO. It is loosely based on the Israeli television miniseries of the same name created by Ron Leshem and Daphna Levin. The series follows a group of high school students through their experiences of identity, trauma, drugs, friendships, love, and sex. It stars Zendaya, who also serves as the series' narrator, alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Maude Apatow, Angus Cloud, Eric Dane, Alexa Demie, Jacob Elordi, Barbie Ferreira, Nika King, Storm Reid, Hunter Schafer, Algee Smith, Sydney Sweeney, Colman Domingo, Javon "Wanna" Walton, Austin Abrams, and Dominic Fike.</p>

		<p>The series premiered on June 16, 2019. In July 2019, the series was renewed for a second season, preceded by two one-hour specials broadcast in December 2020 and January 2021. The second season premiered on January 9, 2022. In February 2022, the series was renewed for a third season.</p>

		<p>Since its debut, Euphoria has received positive reviews, with praise for its cinematography, story, score, performances of the cast (particularly Zendaya and Schafer), and approach to its mature subject matter, though it has been considered controversial for its nudity and sexual content, which some critics found excessive. The series received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best International Programme, and the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. For her performance, Zendaya won a Primetime Emmy Award and a Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series.</p>
