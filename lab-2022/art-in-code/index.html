	<h1>Studio Ghibli</h1>

	<p>Studio Ghibli Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo. It is best known for its animated feature films, and has also produced several short subjects, television commercials, and one television film. Its mascot and most recognizable symbol is a character named Totoro, a giant catlike spirit from the 1988 anime film My Neighbor Totoro. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are Spirited Away (2001), Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and Ponyo (2008).[2] The studio was founded on June 15, 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the successful performance of Topcraft's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984). It has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.</p>

	<p>Five of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan. Spirited Away is second, grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and Princess Mononoke is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen. Many of their works have won the Animage Grand Prix award. Four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of their films have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.</p>

	<p>On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?, which he intended to be his last film.</p>

	<p>The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli (also used in English), based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind (قبلي, 'ghiblī'), the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry". It also refers to an Italian aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309. Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as "Giburi" (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the studio is romanised in Japanese as Jiburi (ジブリ, [dʑiꜜbɯɾi] (audio speaker iconlisten)).</p>

	<h2>The Four Seasons of Ghibli</h2>

		<h3>Spring</h3>
			<p>Spirted Away</p>
			<p>The Wind Rises</p>

		<h3>Summer</h3>
			<p>My Neighbor Totoro</p>
			<p>Ponyo</p>
			<p>Kiki's Delivery Service</p>

		<h3>Fall</h3>
			<p>Howl's Moving Castle</p>
				<p>This one is a bit hard to explain, but I just feel like this is a Ghibli film that we would watch in the fall. When Sophie first walks into the house and out of the cold and warms up sitting in front of Calcifer, hearing the crackling of his flames just makes me imagine how nice it must of felt! Scarecrows are often used in the fall, so having Turnip-Head as a character just adds to the fall feeling. Sophie's outfit, especially her little boots, just makes me think of autumnal bliss! I don't know if any of you get what I mean by all of this, but I many parts just make me feel like Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect Ghibli film to watch in the fall! (Still, it's perfect anytime! :blush: )</p>

		<h3>Winter</h3>
			<p>Castle in the Sky</p>
				<p>Out of my choices for the winter films, this would have to be my favorite! Castle in the Sky is one of my favorites, and I absolutely love it! To me, it has a lot of winter details to it. In Pazu's home town, it looks like it would be about early winter. Since a lot of the film takes place in the sky, the characters often stay cold and have to wear some type of jacket. In the beginning of the film, when Sheeta has to disguise herself in Pazu's clothes, the outfit makes me think of winter. Also, in the beginning of the film, Pazu is shown getting some hot meatballs for his boss at a crowded vendor type of place, and that part reminds me of the hot foods we eat during the colder season. When Pazu is shown working in the mine, I'm reminded of winter again since mines are usually cold. Pazu and Sheeta are also shown in a different mine, where it also would have been cold. Later in that same mine when they visit with Uncle Pomme, they have a "cup o' joe" to warm them up, and that makes me think of drinking hot drinks during winter even more! Another thing that reminds me of winter is that in Castle in the Sky, Sheeta and Pazu help protect each other no matter what, and I think that expresses the true meaning of love and being there for each other, which are important customs during winter!</p>
			<p>Princess Monoke</p>
				<p>I think Princess Mononoke is a great Ghibli film to watch in the winter, mainly because of the forest setting. It doesn't really talk place in winter, but it still reminds me of it. The woodland aspects of forests always reminds me of winter, and when I see the forest in Princess Mononoke, it makes me think of the snowy forests that always seem to create a winter wonderland! Princess Mononoke focuses on nature themes, and how we should conserve nature and take care care of it. If it snows in the wintertime, we find ourselves playing in the wonderful snow outside and really remembering how amazing nature truly is! I just feel like when you sit on a comfortable couch in the winter, wrapped up in soft blankets with a nice hot drink, you might be watching Princess Mononoke!</p>
