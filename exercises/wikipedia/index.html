		<h2>Background and Release</h2>
			<p>Love Yourself: Answer was first announced on July 16, 2018, with the announcement of the album containing seven new tracks coming the following day. The album was designed as the finale of the Love Yourself series, which connected the story plot of short film Love Yourself 起 Wonder, EP Love Yourself 承 'Her', and studio album Love Yourself 轉 'Tear', forming the "起承轉結 (기승전결) (Kishōtenketsu)" storytelling composition.</p>

			<p>On August 6, Big Hit Entertainment released a Most Beautiful Moment in Life note, part of a series of fictional notes pertaining to the concept of BTS' albums, starting with their 2015 EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1. The note, written by BTS member Jin, spoke about him finding a notebook written by his father in the story. The book discussed the father's failures. Three days later, on August 9, the trailer for the album, featuring a new song entitled "Epiphany", was released. The solo, described by Billboard's Tamar Herman as a "building pop-rock melody", was performed by Jin, and speaks about finding self-love. The song serves as one of the tracks for the album. The trailer was directed by Yong-seok Choi (Lumpens), and portrays multiple versions of Jin in a room, telling the story of a personal journey. Philip Merrill of the Recording Academy described the video as having a "sense of going backward and forward, through time and through different versions of one's self". Discussing Jin's performance of the video, Hong Hye-min of The Korea Times stated that it was well-acted and emotional, with Jin's "sorrowful, free voice stand[ing] out".</p>

			<p>Promotional concept photos presenting four different themes were released on August 13 for the "S" and "E" versions, and August 16 for the "L" and "F" versions. Version "S" contained elements inspired by New Romanticism, with BTS in bright red boxes surrounded by cameras, eyes, hands, and amplifiers. Concept version "E" contained bright pastels, with BTS members in bubbles filled with fantastical nature elements. The second set of teasers, versions "L" and "F", were brighter, with BTS members wearing a mix of retro streetwear and formal blazers and suits. In addition, version "L" contained black-and-white images, collaged with the contrasting bright photographs. The official tracklist was released on August 20, revealing that it would be a compilation album containing songs from Love Yourself: Her and Love Yourself: Tear, with a total of twenty-five tracks. The tracklist also announced remixed versions of BTS' previous singles "DNA", "Mic Drop" and "Fake Love". On August 22, 2018, the teaser for "Idol" was released. On August 24, two hours before the release of Love Yourself: Answer, Big Hit Entertainment announced that an alternative version of "Idol" featuring Nicki Minaj will be included in the digital version of the album. Afterwards, the album was released, along with the music video for "Idol". A music video for the Nicki Minaj version of "Idol" was later released on September 6, 2018.</p>

		<h3>Composition</h3>
			<p>Some of the album's themes include empowerment, youth, love, and reflection while the moods exhibited through the album are cathartic, lively, confident, passionate, and yearning among many other things. The genre of the album showcases various types of pop.</p>

			<p>In an interview with Billboard some of the producer's that helped with the album recalled their thought processes and aims for the album. Writer Melanie Fontana, who worked on "Euphoria", wanted the chorus to explode with something more "chanty" but the crowd could sing along easily too. Ray Michael Djan Jr. stated that the song "I'm Fine" was a response to an earlier song he helped write called "Save Me". A lot of drum and bass influenced "I'm Fine" and they blended a lot of different sounds to create it. On the title song "Idol", Ali Tamposi stated the rep from Big Hit wanted the song to feel intense.</p>

			<p>Thematically, Love Yourself: Answer placed the songs of the Love Yourself series within the narrative of beginning, development, turn and conclusion to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love.</p>

		<h3>Critical Reception</h3>
			<p>Love Yourself: Answer received positive reviews from critics. Nemo Kim from the South China Morning Post gave the album four stars out of five and said, "[BTS] rappers show their chops on solo tracks, band send a message to Korean youth about self-love, and single Idol sees them don traditional garb and blend pop with ancient percussion as Minaj joins in," praising the album as "cement[ing] BTS' place as kings of the genre". In a positive review, Taylor Glasby of Clash magazine described the narrative of the album as a "portray[al] of the fears, mistakes and thoughts we inflict on ourselves" which remain "poignantly relatable". In addition, she said that the narrative serves "to remind us that each person must make their own path, and there's no one size fits all answer to achieving self-acceptance". However, for "Answer: Love Myself", the track concluding the narrative on the album, Glasby felt that it "lyrically exceeds although plays the instrumental a little too safe". Tamar Herman of Billboard praised the album, calling it a "masterful culmination of years of work and rife with meaning, Answer is undeniably a magnum opus from BTS that that few other artists, boy bands or otherwise, ever can hope to achieve."</p>
