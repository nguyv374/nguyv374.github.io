	<h3>Fall</h3>
		<p>Howl's Moving Castle</p>
			<p>This one is a bit hard to explain, but I just feel like this is a Ghibli film that we would watch in the fall. When Sophie first walks into the house and out of the cold and warms up sitting in front of Calcifer, hearing the crackling of his flames just makes me imagine how nice it must of felt! Scarecrows are often used in the fall, so having Turnip-Head as a character just adds to the fall feeling. Sophie's outfit, especially her little boots, just makes me think of autumnal bliss! I don't know if any of you get what I mean by all of this, but I many parts just make me feel like Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect Ghibli film to watch in the fall! (Still, it's perfect anytime! :blush: )</p>

	<h3>Winter</h3>
		<p>Castle in the Sky</p>
			<p>Out of my choices for the winter films, this would have to be my favorite! Castle in the Sky is one of my favorites, and I absolutely love it! To me, it has a lot of winter details to it. In Pazu's home town, it looks like it would be about early winter. Since a lot of the film takes place in the sky, the characters often stay cold and have to wear some type of jacket. In the beginning of the film, when Sheeta has to disguise herself in Pazu's clothes, the outfit makes me think of winter. Also, in the beginning of the film, Pazu is shown getting some hot meatballs for his boss at a crowded vendor type of place, and that part reminds me of the hot foods we eat during the colder season. When Pazu is shown working in the mine, I'm reminded of winter again since mines are usually cold. Pazu and Sheeta are also shown in a different mine, where it also would have been cold. Later in that same mine when they visit with Uncle Pomme, they have a "cup o' joe" to warm them up, and that makes me think of drinking hot drinks during winter even more! Another thing that reminds me of winter is that in Castle in the Sky, Sheeta and Pazu help protect each other no matter what, and I think that expresses the true meaning of love and being there for each other, which are important customs during winter!</p>
