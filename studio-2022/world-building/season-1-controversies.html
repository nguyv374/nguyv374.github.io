			<p>"i've rewatched this show so many times and i realized something. everytime rue is tempted by drugs when sober, this songs plays. she definitely overdoosed but did'nt ddie. even when the screen goes black at the end, you can hear birds chirping. she said in her backstory episode that she likes to image that the hospital monitors beeping are just chirping birds. and when she was going through the house, gia and her mom couldn't see her, but her dad could. almost like she was close to death and then he pushed her away. also when the choir ppl have rue in the air and they're like convulsing her, she was probably having a seizure."</p>

			<p>"As a former heroin addict and someone who has overdosed, this scene is 100% conveying a relpse triggered by her breakup with jules. Her walking through the house and stubling, almost fighting the intense high thats building up, was her 'falling out' as we call it in the drug world. Meaning she did too much and she's beginning to OD. Eventually I believe she actually does overdose and her heart stops, around the tine she sees her family and father. The other dancers are other victims of the Opiod epidemic, others that have lost their life to their terrible and hard-to-break lifestyle. Rue, is, I, belive, dancing with spirits. This reminds me of another music video, Acide Rain by Lorn, in which right before the person in the music video dies of trauma from a car crash, she's dancinging with the other victims/spirits of the car crash, her last dance with life. Rue is doing so here, dancing with those that are already gone, almost joing them. The dance moves shown in the scenes tell me that she is in fact found by either her mom or sister and the ambulance was called because it looks like they ae trying ti revive her heart with a defibrillator. The end, when she's climbing the pile of other victims, she's about to 'go into the light' or, you know, die. But she drops... She's revived and brought back to life! She bever full died if tht makes sense. That's my interpretation as an addict at least. We don't know if she instantly came back or is in a coma again, every overdose is unique. But this scene just conveys so much emotion and memory, I cry almost every time I watch it."</p>

			<p>"Euphoria is an example of how to show serous oribkens in an artistic way without romanticizing anything. Everytime it showcases scenes that represent depression I feel a sadness cuz I relate but also glad that it doesn't make mental illness look beautiful abd whn it shows scenes with drugs i can tell that they're not trying to make drugs 'cool' and it shows how there's so much silent suffering that kids my age don't talk about when dealing with drugs and they think it's awesome until they devleop problems on top of the poblems they alray have"</p>

			<p>This last episode made me feel some type of way. I fel angry at Jules for texting Anna and admit to Rue that she's in love with her. I felt sad that Rue felt like a burden for not being tru to her feelings for Jules. I felt anxious at what Nate would do to Maddy. Them, I was bawling at the end because of how many emotions this show made me feel. It is beautifully made show, the scenery, the makeup, the cast. It's all so fuckng captivating and I could not turn away. I watched all 8 episodes in a day. I don not regret a thing."</p>
