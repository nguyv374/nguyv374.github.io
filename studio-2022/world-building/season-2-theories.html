		<h2>Kip</h2>
			<p>do y'all think the colors changing on the title card from blue and purple, to beige and brown mean the characters are maturing?"</p>
		<h2>Omg where'd taht horse come from</h2>
			<p>"so blue and purple is immature?"</p>
		<h2>Kip</h2>
			<p>"@Omg where'd that horse come from  no. that's not what i really meant. to me i feel the colors represent the way the characters percieve life. i guess those colors (blue/purple) meant that they saw life freely? this season look a little more harsh so the characters have a new perspective on things so maybe that's why the colors have changed i guess? it's hard to explain"</p>
